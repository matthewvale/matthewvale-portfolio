        <p>Matthew Vale, solo game developer since 2009.</p>
        <p>I started learning on YouTube in 2009 and made my very first "game", which was called "The Worminator”. Yes, it was as bad as it sounds! I had a 3-sphered worm moving around the map and shooting fireballs! It even had turrets shooting back, amazing!</p>
        <p>In 2010, I finished secondary school and started college in County Durham. I started studying mechanical engineering but moved to Information Technology, where I studied the Microsoft Office Suite, business and project management, C#, 3D modelling, website development and more. In my first year, I made my first published game called Pongdroid3D, which was actually more of a “brick breaker”. This is where I understood how much work, effort and dedication goes into making video games and software.</p>
        <p>Throughout 2013-2015 I was making Android games using the Unity game engine; I was improving my skills, knowledge and understanding of the game industry. These Android games are no longer available, but I (and Google Play Archive) will always remember them: Pongdroid3D, Voxel Raiders, ColourPoint, Circles and Chicky Raft.</p>
        <p>In mid 2015, I started making my 7th video game, Poly Towns. After I finished my 5th year at college (With a grade of Distinction Distinction Merit), I moved back to Manchester. On the 22nd of April 2016, I released Poly Towns on Steam (it only took 9 days to get through Steam Greenlight!), it sold about 300 copies in the first month and still sells to this day.</p>
        <p>On the 5th of October 2017, I released A New World: Kingdoms, my second PC game on Steam. It’s a casual turn-based 4X game inspired by Civilization. A New World: Kingdoms took 7 days to get through Steam Greenlight. Not long after this, Steam retired Greenlight in favour of a new system called Direct. The game had a rocky launch with a couple of game breaking issues that I quickly fixed. It certainly needed more work this one.</p>
        <p>In October 2018, I decided to start studying Computer Science with The Open University.</p>
        <p>On the 12th April 2019 I released Nightmare Trails. This was a rough one, with game breaking bugs at the very start. I did of course fix them, but this game needed a lot more time, content and love.</p>
        <p>On the 3rd September 2019 I released Laservasion, a 2D, retro inspired shooter that makes heavy use of Audio and particle effects. This was a programming beauty behind the scenes and it resulted in a really smooth game. The only trouble is that it didn’t pick up in sales or visibility. It deserved a better life.</p>
        <p>By April 2020, I wasn’t developing for various reasons and did not return to development until November 2021. I am now creating Poly Skies. Head over to the games page to find out more!</p>
